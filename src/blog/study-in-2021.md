## Why am I doing this?

Because, I want to improve upon my current knowledge. The current job has its own learning, but there is so much more outside that gets missed. By learning on a side, It is going to help in the future as it will broaden my opinion as well as it bound to help me with my current work as well.

Also, I love and enjoy learning new things :)

Also, learning needs to be consistent to maximize value out of it. 2-day binge learning and then 5 days of procrastination won’t help overall. 1% consistent improvement is much more desirable to me than fluctuating between 0-10-0-4%.

## What is going to be my improvement area?

I am interested in broad areas of whole software development, but I work on front-end more during my daily dev work. The list is huge, and the whole idea of unknown-unknowns doesn’t keep me in peace and content. But time is limited and I want to start small and most importantly, be consistent. So I’m going to focus on specific areas first and then move onto other topics.

## January 2021 - Foundation

I will be focusing this month on the core skills that won’t solve a specific problem, rather will provide me a solid ground to stand on.

For all topic or concept that I learn and consume, there **must** be a corresponding written output in own words. This is to help with solidifying the knowledge.
